No Javadocs here yet.\r\n\r\n## Configuration API\r\n\r\nIntroduced a new typed configuration API. See [`Config`](https://github.com/WorksApplications/Sudachi/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/worksap/nlp/sudachi/Config.java) class.  It supports flexible path resolution with respect to classpath (with customizable prefixes and classloaders) and filesystem. Dictionary creation API which uses old `Settings` is deprecated. \r\n\r\nNew configuration framework allow specifying some resources (dictionaries, character tables) preloaded and prebuilt.\r\n\r\nFor details on usage, see Javadoc for `Config` class.\r\n\r\n## Fully-custom POS tags in OOV providers\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to specify POS tags for OOV providers which are not present in dictionary. In that case, you must add `\"userPos\": \"allow\"` to OOV plugin configuration. POS tags still must have 6 layer structure.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"oovProviderPlugin\" : [\r\n        { \"class\" : \"com.worksap.nlp.sudachi.SimpleOovProviderPlugin\",\r\n          \"oovPOS\" : [ \"この\", \"たぐ\", \"は\", \"ぞんざい\", \"しない\", \"よ\" ],\r\n          \"userPOS\": \"allow\",\r\n          \"leftId\" : 8,\r\n          \"rightId\" : 8,\r\n          \"cost\" : 6000 }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Regex OOV Provider Plugin\r\n\r\nIntroduced a new OOV provider which matches a regular expression.\r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n* Use non-capturing groups in regular expressions: `(?:like this)`, but not capturing groups `(like this)`\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n* Matches may start only on boundaries where character type changes.\r\n* Matches may not produce words which already present in the dictionary.\r\n* Match length is limited to 63 utf-16 code units\r\n\r\n\r\nExample for matching URLs:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"class\": \"com.worksap.nlp.sudachi.RegexOovProvider\",\r\n    \"leftId\": 5968,\r\n    \"rightId\": 5968,\r\n    \"cost\": 19000,\r\n    \"regex\": \"^(?:https?://|www)[\\\\-_.!~*'()a-zA-Z0-9;/?:@&=+$,%#¯−]+\",\r\n    \"pos\": [ \"補助記号\", \"一般\", \"URL\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\" ],\r\n    \"userPOS\": \"allow\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Speedup\r\n\r\n* Improved lattice construction logic, it is faster and generates less GC pressure now\r\n* Improved trie index lookup logic, it is slightly faster and generates much less GC pressure now\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\nAll deprecations in this section will be removed with 1.0 release.\r\n\r\n* `DictionaryFactory` methods which use `Settings`\r\n* `getPath` method of `Settings`, use `getResource` instead.\r\n\r\n# Internal & Infrastructure\r\n\r\n* Build now uses Gradle instead of Maven\r\n* Tests can be written in Kotlin in addition to Java\r\n* OOV provider plugin internal API has changed. It now must create candidate nodes into the provided list and return number of created OOVs. See Javadoc for details."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/68809229","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/68809229/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/68809229/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/tag/v0.6.0-beta2","id":68809229,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBgPyKc4EGfIN","tag_name":"v0.6.0-beta2","target_commitish":"1bba528c53c1de10d158d9901d7df000d86525fe","name":"Sudachi
